I have created hangman game using perl programming language.
Following are the instruction of how to play the game
->the system will randomly select a word and the player has to guess the word correctly
->the player can guess one letter at a time or a whole word
->one wrong guess and the hangman graph will grow.
->if the hangman graph completes the player loses
->In other words 6 wrong guesses will result in loss.
->all other important instructions are mentioned side by side in the source code.
->after a game finish the system asks player is they want to play again.Player have to enter 'y' to play again and 'n' to exit.

Thanks.
